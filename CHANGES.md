Forked for additional functionality

### Version 1.0 - 10th Aug 2016

Added optional 'doDigest' parameter to publish and subscribe operations.
This defaults to true if unspecified preserving previous behaviour. If passed
as false, a received or sent packet will not cause a digest cycle. 

Change for better colour highlighting in Sublime.
